Create a TwitterBot that appears to exhibit intelligence/creativity. For a successful assignment, it is essential to come up with an interesting and original idea for your Twitterbot. You are encouraged to discuss your ideas with Maya. 

To submit and present your work: 

(1) Submit all code and documentation, a link to your online bot, and presentation slides, onto Camino. Please have your bot follow @ackermanmaya so that Maya could follow your bot back. Make sure your Twitterbot posts sufficiently many Tweets before the deadline (at least 5). 

(2) Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation/demo on your TwitterBot. Those who do not present in class will present in their lab. The presentation should address how the bot was made and include several interesting examples of its output. In addition, please prepare a demo of your bot, by having it produce new Tweets during the live demo.
